What I learned so far, doing AoC2025:

Day 1:
- [Golang] How to declare an Enum, and the `iota` keyword
- [Golang] Using a `switch` case instead of `if` statements
- [Claude] Guiding it with a "short leash" for part 1 with success, tried giving it more freedom in part 2 which failed
- [Claude] Using it to refactor aggressively and quickly
- [Claude] Using it to explain its code and use it as a tutor
